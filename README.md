# Gesture-Recognition-for-Smart-TV-Control-Using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on developing a gesture recognition model that enables smart-TV control through hand gestures, eliminating the need for a physical remote. The model is trained to recognize five different user gestures using deep learning techniques.
